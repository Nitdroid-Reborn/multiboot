Wellcome to bootmenu2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a completely rewritten bootmenu for Maemo 5.


To install the tar ball, do

	cd /
	tar xzvf .../bootmenu2.xxx.tar.gz


All the configuration files are in /etc.


The items in /etc/bootmenu.d/<item>.item can have the following keys:

-- A line starting with # is a comment

-- ITEM_NAME="..."
	A description string for this item.
	Shown on the bootmenu screen.

-- ITEM_MODULES="..."
	A list of kernel modules required to boot this item.
	E.g. "omap_hsmmc mmc_core mmc_block ext3"

-- ITEM_DEVICE="..."
	The device name for the root partition.
	Use ${EXT_CARD} to point to the external MMC,
	and ${INT_CARD} for internal.
	E.g. "${EXT_CARD}p2"

-- ITEM_FSTYPE="..."
	Filesystem type for the root fs.
	Usually ext3. 
	Also, you must have the fs module loaded.

-- ITEM_FSOPTIONS="..."
	Filesystem options for root fs.
	Typically for ext3:
		"rw,noatime,errors=remount-ro,commit=3"

-- ITEM_INITRC=".."
	Init program to execute when switching over to root.
	Optional, has good defaults.

-- ITEM_INITFS="..."
	Locations where the Maemo root is moved after pivot.
	Typically "initrd" or "mnt/initfs"
 	Defaults to "initrd"


Also, bootmenu2 loads the kernel power configuration.

	If file /etc/power.conf is present, it takes precedence.
	If not, the defaults back to /etc/pmconfig.

	Also, if booting an extern OS, the file <ROOT>/etc/power.conf
	is checked first.



Commands in the selection view:


1..9	Boot the numbered item 	
0	Boot default (Maemo)

BS	Reboot
X	Poweroff

B	Fallback to use the original Maemo script to boot maemo

S	Starts a shell





Enjoy!
